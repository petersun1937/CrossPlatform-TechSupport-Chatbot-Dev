Remote Work Policy

Our company supports flexible working hours and remote work. Employees can choose to work from home or in the office, depending on their needs.

The remote work policy includes guidelines for communication, productivity, and collaboration. Employees are expected to attend regular virtual meetings and provide updates on their progress.

For technical support, employees can contact the IT department through our internal ticketing system. Any issues with remote work setup should be resolved promptly to ensure a smooth workflow.

This policy applies to all full-time employees. Temporary workers or contractors should discuss their remote work options with their supervisors.
